<h1>HTML REFRESHER</h1>
<p>It has been a while since I have written <b>HTML</b> in this format. Usually I use a program, such as <b><i>'Dream Weaver'</i></b>to create the codes for me.</p>
<p>The only thing I usually do with the code once created is tweak how it appears and ensure that everything is formated accordingly. With that being said, 
I do review the code to ensure that anyone editing my work can read it and understand what I did orginally. </p>
